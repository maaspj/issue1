\section{Introduction}
In this paper we contribute new evidence on the relationship between public support, innovation and productivity at the firm level in Colombia by investigating several unexplored issues. First we identify and compare the profile of firms that have access to public support for innovation in manufacturing and service industries separately; second, we examine whether the association between the introduction of innovations and productivity varies across the productivity distribution; third, we distinguish between technological and non-technological innovation, since the latter may be especially relevant in the service industries relative to manufacturing.
